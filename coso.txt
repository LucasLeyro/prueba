I'm Lucas (26M) from Argentina and i like money ngl.
+I have an undemanding home office job, my classes are online as well and i have minimal social life, so i'm pretty much available about 18 hours a day.
+I'm up in case you need late-night emergency breeding or whatever, won't judge.
+Will grind both PvE and PvP as much as posible, i like money.
+I have many friends playing, so if i have any doubts i will bother them, not you, The Manager.
+Spent a lot of time playing Pokemon (for free, even) and other turn-based games, so i guess i get around.
+Won't guilt trip you if you decide to lay me off for whatever reason (hope not tho).
+I'll like your instagram posts if you ask me to.
+Can bench 2.5 plates.
+I'll take the game seriously. Might punch a wall if i ever lose.
+Currently on a scolarship, looking for a viable pvp team
DM me if you have any questions or want to play some Brawl Stars.
